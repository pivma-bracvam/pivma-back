## Notes

- Clarifications resolved on 2026-08-11: password length is 8 to 128 characters without
  composition rules; username and e-mail lose external spaces, e-mail comparison ignores case,
  username comparison preserves case; unauthenticated registration leaves creation authorship
  absent.
- All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for review and `$speckit-plan` after
  approval.
